I was born in Providence, Rhode Island and lived there until going to Villanova University to study mechanical engineering and play football. Afterwards, I went to the University of Notre Dame for my PhD, which I am in my third year of pursuing. I love learning how things work and sharing what I love through teaching and mentorship. My research is focused on integrating model-based and learning-based control strategies for the control of legged robots, and I am also deeply interested in the ethics of technology and how we can best use robots to encourage human flourishing. 

 # Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
